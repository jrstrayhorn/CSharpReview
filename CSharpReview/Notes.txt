Constructors

What is it?
	- A method that is called when an instance of an object 
	is created

Why?
	- to put a class in an early state, with initial state

How?
	public class Customer
	{
		// parameter less constructor
		public Customer()
		{
			// required initialization
		}

		// if you don't provide a constructor
		// compiler will add one for you.
		// and initializes fields for value type to default
		// char to empty char
		// ref types to null
	}

	this references the current object
	public class Customer
	{
		public string Name;

		public Customer(string name)
		{
			this.Name = name; // this makes sure we set members of class
		}
	}
