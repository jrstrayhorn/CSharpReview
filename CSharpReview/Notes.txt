Sealed Class

Sealed Modifier
- prevents derivation of classes or ovrriding of methods
- Can't derive from sealed classes

public sealed class Circle : Shape
	public sealed override void Draw() -- if not overriding a method, dont use this

Sealed classes are slightly faster bc of some run-time optimizations

Not widely used if at all.. might be an anti-pattern

Dont use this!!!
