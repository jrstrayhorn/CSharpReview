Upcasting (NOT Boxing and Unboxing LOL...)

public class Shape
{
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
}

Circle circle = new Circle();
Shape shape = circle;

Downcasting

Circle circle = new Circle();
Shape shape = circle;

Circle anotherCircle = (Circle)shape;
Car car = (Car)shape; // throws InvalidCastException

The as keyword
Car car = (Car) obj;

Car car = obj as Car;
if (car != null)
{
}

The is keyword

if (obj is Car)
{
	Car car = (Car) obj;
}
