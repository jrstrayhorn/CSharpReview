What are Extension Methods?

Allow us to add methods to an existing class without
- changing its source code, or
- creating a new class that inherits from it

Due to fact that instance methods take priority over extension methods,
you should create them as a last resort

You should create a new class that derives from class that you want to extend
and place your new method there.

Most of the time we will be using extension methods like from LINQ
versus creating them
