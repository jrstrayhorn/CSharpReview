Types in C#
	1. Value types
	2. Reference types

Value Types
	- Are stored on the stack.
	- Have short life time, when doen off the stack
	- Examples:
		- All primitive types: byte, int, float, char bool
		- The struct type

Reference Types
	- Are stored in the heap
	- Examples:
		- Any classes (Object, Array, String, DBMirgatart)

An object reference can be implicitly converted to a base calss reference
	Circle circle = new Circle();
	Share

the object clss is the base of all classes in .NET framework

object shape = circle; / object reference implictly converted

Boxing
- The process of converting a value type instane to an object reference

int number = 10;
object obj = number;

// or 
object obj = 10;

value gets boxed by CLR and stored in the HEAP instead of STACK

Unboxing

object obj = 10;
int number = (int)obj; // new variable on the stack

Boxing / Unboxing
- have a performance penalty so try to avoid as possible
