What is Inheritance?
	- A kind of relationship between two classes that allows one to inherit
		code from the other.
	- Is-A
	- Example: A Car is a Vehicle

Benefits
	- Code re-use
	- Polymorphic behavior

PowerPoint
	- Could create classes for each object Shape, Image, Text, Table
	- Don't want to rewrite similar behavior between each of these Presentation Objects

	SO....

	Classes for PowerPoint

	PresentationObject (Parent/Base Class/Superclass)
		Text (Child/Derived/Subclass)
		Table (Child)
		Image (Child)

	In C# a class can have only 1 base/parent class.

	Object is the parent of all classes in .NET (automatically)
		so you get methods like Equals, GetType, GetHashCode, ToString on all objects

Syntax

public class PresentationObject
{
	// Common shared code
}

public class Text : PresentationObject
{
	// Code specific to Text
}
