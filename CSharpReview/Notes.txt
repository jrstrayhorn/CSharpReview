What is Coupling?
	A measure of how interconnected classes and subsystem are

Application
	If Class A is coupled with ClassF and ClassB,
		Change in ClassA might change ClassF and ClassB
		This could have a BIG impact on the application

Tightly Coupled Design
	Class are tightly coupled are bad because you can break things

Loose Coupled
	This helps minimize changes, so changes can be isolated

But how?
	You need to understnad
		- Encapsulation 
			(hiding implementation details, 
			putting correct responsibilities, 
			capabilities, data/knowledge and abilities into correct classes)
			No class knows about the implementation details of another class
			via access modifiers
		- The relationships between classes
		- Interfaces

Types of Relationships
	- Inheritance
	- Composition - result in less coupling

Favor Composition Over Inheritance
