Generics

Generic create a class once and reuse it multiple places

C# Indexer

Indexers allow instances of a class or struct to be indexed just like arrays.
The indexed value can be set or retrieved without explictly specifying a type
or instance member.  Indexers resemble properties except that their accessors
take parameters.

// assumes you have some sort of backing data structure to store list of 
// Books like an array, you could then get and set this use

// var bookList = new BookList();
// var myBook = bookList[0];  // would use indexer to get first book in data structure

public class BookList
public Book this[int index]
        {
            get { throw new NotImplementedException(); }
        }
