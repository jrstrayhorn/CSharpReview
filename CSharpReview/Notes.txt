Fields

Fields is a variable that is declared at the class level

- Initialization

public class Customer
{
	List<Order> Orders;

	public Customer()
	{
		Orders = new List<Order>();
	}
}

// we can have multiple constructors and ordder fields will always be initialized
public class Customer
{
	List<Order> Orders = new List<Order>();
}

- Read only Fields - will only be assigned once

public class Customer
{
	readonly List<Order> Orders = new List<Order>();
}

// this increases robustness
// orders list will only be created once and can't be reinitialized
