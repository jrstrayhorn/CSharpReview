What is Composition?
	- A kind of relationship between two classes that allows one to contain the other
	- Has-a relationship
	- Example: Car has an Engine

Benefits
	- Code re-use
	- Flexiblity
	- Means to loose-coupling

Example
	- DbMigrator requires logging.  // copying database, tables, views, etc
	- Installer requires logging.   // install application
		Logging is common between both class

			DbMigrator > Logger

			Installer > Logger

Syntax

public class Installer
{
	private Logger _logger;

	// related class is a private field in composite class
	public Installer(Logger logger)
	{
		_logger = logger;
	}
}
