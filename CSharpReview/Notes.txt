Exception in C# is a class
	property - called message

	Source - namespace/assembly/DLL where exception happened

	TargetSite - is where method happened

	Stack Trace - shows sequence of methods until exception was thrown

Our apps shouldn't crash
We should always have a global exception handling block (try/catch)

WPF should have a main method
ASP.NET has a different way to do it

Xamarin?
